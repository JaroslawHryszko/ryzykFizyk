# Risk Assessment Tool

## Overview
The Risk Assessment Tool is designed to facilitate the evaluation of risks associated with software development projects. It offers an intuitive web interface where users can choose between two distinct approaches to risk assessment: comparing risks directly or utilizing a risk matrix.

## Features
- **Two Assessment Methods:**
  - **Comparing Risks:** Users are presented with two risks and must decide which one poses a greater threat.
  - **Risk Matrix:** Allows users to place risks on a probability-impact matrix, offering a visual representation of risk severity.
- **Interactive Elements:** Utilizes drag-and-drop functionality for the Risk Matrix and clickable options for risk comparison.
- **Dynamic Content:** Generates descriptions of fictional risks in natural language, enhancing the user experience and engagement.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
