# Software Development Risk Comparator

## Overview
This project is an interactive web application designed to engage users in comparing fictional risks associated with software development projects. It features a simple yet elegant interface where two different risks are presented side by side. Users are asked to compare these risks by deciding which one could potentially have a greater impact on a project. The application also includes a timer to track how long a user takes to make a decision, enhancing the interactive experience.

## Features
- **Dynamic Risk Comparison:** Users can compare two randomly generated software development risks.
- **Interactive Timer:** Tracks the duration it takes for a user to make a decision.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive and can be used on various devices and screen sizes.
- **User Interaction:** Simple and intuitive interface allowing users to interact with the application effortlessly.

## Technology Stack
- HTML: For structuring the web application.
- CSS: For styling and responsive design.
- JavaScript: For dynamic content generation and interactive elements.
